The new Careers Page:

Shows off the place in a way that will make it look like a comfortable place to work. (So, a specific small subset of the pics that serve this exact purpose.)

Highlights me as a supervisor, with copy from me where I convey a beautiful vision of what our supervisory relationship will be, in a manner that is compelling to them.

A prominent place for at least two testimonials, with pictures and possibly links, from two of my former supervisees. (They have already agreed to this and will write a specific testimonial for this purpose within the next few weeks.)

Explains the highlights of the job offer.
