The New Association Page:

A page that explains the association in a compelling way, with the purpose of selling it to those wishing to be in private practice.

Highlights the benefits of the association, especially the use of the space and the camaraderie. (As well as shared referrals.)

A profile for my accountant, Michael Flax, with his picture, a blurb that he will write, and commentary about how he will conduct periodic webinars for the association members, with a link to his website. (He has agreed to this- The purpose mostly is to bolster my appearance as being more legitimate, with Flax as part of my ‘team.’)
