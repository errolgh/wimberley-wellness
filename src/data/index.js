        `What you need, who you are is what matters in therapy. This isn’t
      about you being “educated” about how you should think and how you
      should live, as sometimes, unfortunately happens. The real work is in
      the discovery and application of your inherent strengths, in the
      service of your aims in life. That’s exactly what we’ll do.`,
        `Wimberley Wellness Therapy is in Baltimore with offering of in-person
      and remote psychotherapy. The authentic and empathetic approach used
      here is the bedrock of the practice. Never will it be a rote
      application of a generic concept from a book. It’s going to be real
      here and you will feel it.`,
